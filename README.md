# Desiglab Re-branding & Design System

Working on the Designlab re-branding and the creation of a visual design system represented a significant milestone in my career as a UX/UI designer. Designlab, a leader in design education, sought to refresh its brand identity and establish a comprehensive visual design system that would reflect its innovative approach to teaching design. My role in this project came after a branding agency laid the foundational proposal for the rebranding. I was tasked with expanding upon this proposal by broadening the color palette, creating unique iconography for each color, and developing templates for various deliverables.

### My Role

As a UX/UI designer, I spearheaded the efforts to enrich and implement the new visual design system for Designlab. This included taking the initial branding proposal and expanding it to create a more versatile and expressive visual language that could be applied across all platforms and communications. My responsibilities involved:

- Expanding the color palette to include a wider range of shades and tones, ensuring versatility and accessibility in digital and print mediums.
- Designing a set of unique icons for each color in the palette, symbolizing different aspects of the Designlab experience and offerings.
- Creating templates for key deliverables, including web pages, marketing materials, course content, and student resources, ensuring consistency and coherence in the brand's visual presentation.

### Design Process

The process of enhancing and applying the new visual design system involved several key steps:

1. **Expansion of Color Palette:** Based on the initial color scheme proposed by the branding agency, I conducted a thorough analysis of current design trends, accessibility standards, and the psychological impact of colors. This informed the development of an expanded palette that was both aesthetically pleasing and functional for various applications.

2. **Iconography Design:** For each color in the new palette, I designed a set of icons that captured the essence of Designlab's brand values and educational pillars. This involved sketching, digital illustration, and testing to ensure that each icon was both distinct and cohesive within the overall visual system.

3. **Template Development:** Utilizing the expanded color palette and new iconography, I created a series of templates for different types of deliverables. Each template was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for easy adaptation to various content types while maintaining brand consistency.

4. **Collaboration and Feedback:** Throughout the design process, I worked closely with the marketing team, content creators, and other stakeholders at Designlab to gather feedback and ensure that the visual design system met the diverse needs of the organization.

5. **Implementation and Guidelines:** Once the design elements were finalized, I collaborated with the development team to implement the visual design system across all digital platforms. I also created comprehensive brand guidelines, documenting the use of color, typography, iconography, and templates to ensure consistency in future applications.

6. **Monitoring and Iteration:** After the launch of the rebranded materials, I monitored the reception and effectiveness of the visual design system, making iterative improvements based on user feedback and evolving brand needs.

The Designlab re-branding and visual design system project was a deeply rewarding challenge that allowed me to contribute to shaping the brand's future direction. By expanding the color palette, creating meaningful iconography, and developing versatile templates, I aimed to create a visual identity that was both distinctive and reflective of Designlab's commitment to design education excellence. This project underscored the importance of thoughtful design in communicating brand values and enhancing user engagement across various touchpoints.
